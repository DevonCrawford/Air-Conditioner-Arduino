# Air-Conditioner-Arduino

When your AC doesn't work.. make one with arduino!! Each room has it's own temperature sensors, 
ventilation shafts and fan controllers. It was the arduino's job to monitor the room temperature
and control the fans to achieve the desired temperature. Surprisingly it worked quite well. Considering
we simply used the window (thanks candian winters!) as our cold air source.
